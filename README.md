## ðŸš© Overview
### What's MaiPet & MAI Agent
MaiPet is the MAI Agent Desktop Pet. She is an AI-driven desktop assistant to help Web3 investors seamlessly analyze market data and manage emotional interactions with real-time insights.
The MaiPet Avatar running on the PC desktop first has the capabilities of an Agent tool, which can sense user actions/actions/content, and even emotions/sentiment in real time. Then it can be used as a desktop tool to help users perceive and operate multiple applications. The "sense/perception" and "operation" here are not just the capabilities of the user himself or his real assistant/subordinates. Based on the blessing of Agents and LLM, MaiPet can obtain more and richer auxiliary information in the network based on real-time "perception"., and analyze and predict by AI, and perform post-decision operations.

The MAI Agent is an innovative personal AI tool, crafted to empower users to efficiently and intelligently engage the Web3 ecosystem, enabling everyone to easily create their own IP Agents to perform functions such as AlphaScout and account management. More than just a smart assistant, the MAI Agent can emulate popular influencers, automatically curating and delivering the latest trending content, project updates, and market insights based on user interests and behaviors.

The name "MAI Agent" serves a dual purpose: it stands for "My AI Agent". MAI Agent contains multiple Agent Tools, MaiPet is one of them.
